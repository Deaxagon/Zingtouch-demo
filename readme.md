<h1> Zingtouch demo </h1>


This is a demo of ZingTouch developed by Zingchart.
ZingTouch is a JavaScript touch gesture library. The library allows developers to configure pre-existing gestures as well as create their own very easily.

Their documentation is available here: https://zingchart.github.io/zingtouch

ZingTouch comes with 6 main gestures :

    Tap
    Swipe
    Pinch
    Expand
    Pan
    Rotate

These gestures can be customized including the number of inputs it accepts, or how sensitive the gesture is to be recognized.
In our demo we showcase 4 of these: Tap, Swipe, pinch and pan.
